Setting up a local server (for security purpose):
1) In the terminal wrie: python3 -m http.server (or whichever python version available)
2) Open webpage as: http://yourlocalserver:8000/1.html

Once opened in local browser the webpage will show  few ways of embedding 
images in html pages and two links one that opens the image in a new tab and 
the other is the source of the image.
